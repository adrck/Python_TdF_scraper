# Python_scraper
First Python project to scrape data and use it for a Tour de France competition with friends.

I am scraping rider data from the Procyclingstats website. This has been a succesful effort.
Currently trying to add data from the stage results. More specifically, the results from individual climbs during a stage. 
So far I can not really get this work as I would like.
I want to extract the results from the HTML and save that data in an Excel file. In case there is more than one climb the results should be saved in one and the same sheet. Preferably with the climb's name above the results.
